# Design Problems

This directory stores different kinds of design problems and their implementations.
This will also contain the design patterns used in Software Engineering to solve
common problems.

## Last N Average Problem

Design a system which stores the average of last n values seen in a stream of 
integers.

## Moving Average Problem

Design a system which stores or returns the average of all numbers in a stream
of integers.

## Strategy Pattern

This is a design which is used or implemented when we have a class which has 
a set of behaviors which can change over time and is most expected to change.
You can follow the Headfirst Design Patterns for a better understanding of the
logic behind having this pattern. The Design Puzzle in the chapter of Strategy
Pattern has been solved here.
