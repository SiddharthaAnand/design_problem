# Design Puzzle One (Strategy Pattern)
This is a solution to a specific kind of design problem
which has already been faced by many experienced 
developers. I will describe the problem in detail 
which has been referenced from this [awesome book]().

## Identifying the Problem
We are going to design an Action-Adventure Game. For
the sake of learning, we will keep our design limited
to a few classes. The technical problem statement is
as follows:
 - The game will have different *Characters*.
 - Every character will have different kinds 
 of *Weapons*.
 - The behavior of weapons can change.
 - Each character can use only one weapon at a time,
 but can change to any other weapon at any point 
 in time.

## Suggesting a Solution(s)
Though I'll try to explain in detail about the 
solution we reach at, for more understanding, you 
can go through the first chapter of the mentioned 
book, and go over the **Duck example**.


## Implementing it!
This directory consists of files which has been taken
as an example above and implemented the solution
using Strategy Pattern based on above suggested answer.
